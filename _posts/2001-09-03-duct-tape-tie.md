Yeah, I actually wore this tie to school one day during high school. (I went to a [private catholic high school](https://www.stjohnshigh.org/) that requires its students to wear ties.) It was quite funny. A few days later, I happened to be operating the school's digital camera, so I decided to take a picture of myself. Heh, I never expected to see it in a calendar, though.
