Note: These pages are quite old, but I prefer to leave them as-is. Their style is quite similar to how the web looked in the early 2000s.

> I currently own a set of self-built DIY Voight Pipes.  There are four traditional pipes used for both my front and surround speakers, and a modified pipe for my center channel.  All five speakers use a single Radio-Shack 8" 35-Watt full-range driver.  (40-1044)  What follows are two pages, one describing my the construction and use of the five speakers, and the other describing my quest to magnetically shield the drivers so that they won't interfere with my television and cause data loss.
